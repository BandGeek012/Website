        <p>I graduated from Andover High School in 1985 and received my DVM from Kansas State University of Veterinary Medicine in 1993. Beginning my career in Springfield, MO, I have been practicing in Kingman since 1994. During that time, my husband Tom and I had 3 daughters, Sophie, Hattie, and Greta. In 2007, I began my own practice. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, exercising, and working on my yard.</p>
